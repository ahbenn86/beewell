# Bee Well 🐝

**_Bee Well_** is a simple CRUD operating app for posting and deleting wellness articles. It was developed using the _MERN_ stack. 

In your text editor simply change your directory to the client directory using command _"cd client"_.

```
cd client 
```
Then run npm install in your terminal. 

```
npm install
```
Then open an additional terminal and change it's directory to "cd server".

```
cd server
```
Now run npm install in that terminal

```
npm install
```
The app will load and automatically open in a new tab.    

_Bee Well_. 🙂
